# 🎨 AI Art Style Transfer on Real-World Photos

This project applies artistic painting styles (like **Van Gogh's Starry Night**) to real-world photos using a **deep learning model** from TensorFlow Hub.

It performs **neural style transfer**, blending the content of one image with the artistic style of another.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **Content Image** → Your photo (e.g., landscape, portrait)
- **Style Image** → Famous artwork (e.g., Van Gogh, Monet)
- **Output** → Content photo stylized with artistic texture and colors



---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow** & **TensorFlow Hub**
- **Python (3.9+)**
- **NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow**
- **Google Colab** (for GPU + easy execution)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the notebook → [AI STYLE PROJECT.py](notebook/AI_Art_Style_Transfer.ipynb)
2. Upload your content and style images.
3. Run all cells — see the stylized result instantly.
